# human_depth_robot_control
Controlling the speed of UR Robots with Human Distance approximation with YOLOv8 and Microsoft Azure Kinect DK

"Main" Branch only has this readme. All files are in branch "Master".

To run this project, ensure you have the Microsoft Azure Kinect SDK set up, a UR Robot or URSim environment connected over local IP and all of the necessary libraries to be imported installed.

Select either RGB or IR (Infrared) file and run. The InfraRed program is more recent and has more accurate depth approximation, though it is slightly more difficult to observe the frame output.
